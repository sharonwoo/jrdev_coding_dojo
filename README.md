# Junior Developers SG Coding Dojo

Python (currently -only) exercises with https://github.com/JuniorDevSingapore/coding_dojo. Also practising git with Sourcetree via https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite/wiki/Git-step-by-step:-Part-1 and of course, Stackoverflow. 

Special thanks to **Michael Cheng**, who made time to teach me the basics and who is an all around awesome person.
